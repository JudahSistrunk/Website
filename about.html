		        Having recently graduated in 2016, I, Judah Sistrunk, received my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems from LeTourneau University. 
		        The purpose of this website is to show off some of my programming skills. 
                My hobbies include programming, game development, 3D modeling, and playing video games. 
                The Games tab showcases some of the games that I have worked on, and the Renders tab showcases some of my 3D modeling projects.

		        In the spring of 2015, I participated in a seventy-two-hour game development competition. 
		        For this event, my team developed a game called Weapon Globber, a procedurally-generated dungeon exploration game where the player finds random items and sticks them together to make a rather unconventional weapon. 
		        The player must travel through the levels of the dungeon collecting items while looking for the exit. 
		        The game is endless, and the goal is to see how long the player can survive. 
		    </p>

		       During the summer of 2016, I participated in a summer internship with LightSys, a missionary tech support organization. 
		       LightSys provides tech support for mission organizations and designs apps that help mission organizations. 
		       One of its main products is a mission administration application called Kardia, a database system that helps organizations keep track of and coordinate with their missionaries. 
		       I worked on the donor app for Kardia, which lets donors keep track of who they have donated to and how much they have donated. 
		       It also lets donors view prayer letters and updates from missionaries and lets donors send messages to missionaries. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
		       Most of my projects, including all my LightSys work, are available on his GitHub account. 
		       My GitHub username is JudahSistrunk. 
		       Weapon Globber is also on GitHub, but it is under the name HashTag Cake.
