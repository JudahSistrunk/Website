			   My name is Judah Sistrunk, and this is a page detailing my work on various projects. 
			   In the summer 2016, I helped an organization called LightSys in the development of a suite of Android apps. 
			   The apps are part of the Kardia missionary administrative database system, which keeps track of missionaries for a mission organization. 
			   One of the main apps that I worked on was Kardia’s donor app. 
			   This app lets donors keep track of who they have donated money to and how much they have donated. 
			   It lets donors see prayer letters and updates from the missionaries as well as send messages to the missionaries. 
			   I worked on a system that automatically updates the app's local database every given time period. 
			   I also worked on a system to send comments on posts along with other minor improvements to the app. 
			   The other app that I worked on while at LightSys was the Kardia CRM app, an elaborate contacts list that syncs to the Kardia database. 
			   Instead of adding functionality to this app, the app's code was in such bad shape that I spent most of his time making it readable. 
			   However, I did add the ability to update contact information to a particular contact in the app. 
			   Both Kardia’s donor and CRM apps use JSON and REST APIs to interact with a database. 
			   While working on these apps, I created a class that allows developers to easily send information to the server, streamlining the development of the apps. 
			   Both of these apps can be found on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/LightSys/kardia/tree/master/kardia-android" target="_blank">here</a>.
